    <strong>Immunization Compliance</strong> <br>

    <br>Student veterans enrolled solely in online courses are not required to be in compliance.  Once registered for a course requiring attendance on campus, these students must meet all requirements. <br>

<p><strong>Sallie Mae Payment Plan For Remaining Balance (if applicable)</strong>- 
Should a tuition/fees balance exist after the application of your VA/GI BILL educational benefits, 
it must be remitted in FULL prior to each semester&#39;s balance payment deadline to avoid incurring 
the university&#39;s late fee. Similarly should you be residing in the campus dormitories, 
you are responsible to remit the room/board related charges in full prior to each semester&#39;s 
balance payment deadline to be permitted to move into the dorms and not incur the late fee. 
This may be accomplished either by paying out of pocket, accepting loans, 
or enrolling in the university&#39;s 0% interest payment plan offered 
through <a href="https://tuitionpay.salliemae.com/TuitionPay/Welcome.aspx" target="_blank">Sallie Mae</a>. 
It is prohibited to pay the room/board related charges on a semester-by-semester basis directly 
upon receiving your GI BILL educational benefit&#39;s monthly basic allowance for housing (BAH). 
All room/board charges must be paid up front prior to moving in.</p>

<strong>Statement</strong> <Br />


I understand that in order to comply with Veterans Administration (VA) regulations, Pace University must submit registration and, at times, academic progress reports to the VA. Moreover, I understand that any changes in my registration status or enrollment (e.g. add, drop, withdrawal) may affect the VA benefit amounts and, as a result, other financial aid, I receive.  Furthermore I understand that making any changes to my enrollment status/course schedule after the start of the term may result in the VA issuing a prorated payment thus penalizing me, even if I am 100% covered under federal educational VA benefits. Finally, I understand that I am responsible for any outstanding balance on my student account that is not covered by VA benefits.
